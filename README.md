Stratego is a game where two players place 40 pieces on their side of the battlefield and use them to attempt to capture an opponents flag.
The game ends when all of one players moveable (the bomb and flag aren't) pieces are captured or a flag is captured. 

Some notes (bugs) on play:
When placing pieces, it is possible to accidently mis click on the board before a piece is selected to place. This messes up which piece 
is loaded and ready to place so it seems like you can't place. When this happens, double tap on the piece you wish to place and continue
placing as normal.
